# PKGW’s Website

This is the source code for [my personal website](https://newton.cx/~peter/).
The HTML is generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a great static site
generator tool.

Feel free to crib from this! The theme is of my own design. To generate the
site, just run

```
zola build
```

or

```
zola serve
```

to serve it locally.
