Well, I’ve just filed my dissertation with UC Berkeley, so I’m essentially
done with my PhD! I’ve uploaded an electronic copy of my thesis
[here](/dissertation/). I’ll be giving an exit seminar summarizing my work
(and probably digressing a fair bit, because why not?)
[on Monday](http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/astro?event_ID=55346).
It’s been a great time at Berkeley, though I’m also pretty excited to return
to Harvard to work with [Edo Berger](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~eberger/).
Onward!
