[Six months after the last AAS](./2009/aas-213-poster.md), I gave
another poster at the [214th AAS meeting](http://aas.org/meetings/aas214/) in
Pasadena. The topic this time was the launch of the AGCTS project. The
abstract for the poster isn’t on ADS quite yet, but I think it should show up
[here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AAS...21460103W). Its session
identifier was #601.03.

Here’s a
[PDF](/~peter/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/poster.pdf) of
this poster (2.5 MB). As before, this is unpublished and unreviewed, and it
describes _extremely_ preliminary work.
