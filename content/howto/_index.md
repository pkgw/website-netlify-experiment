A *very* miscellaneous collection of guides about how to do things. Mainly,
how to get computers to do the things you want them to do.

(This section name pays homage to the long-standing tech tradition of
“[HOWTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How-to)” documents, which has often
bloomed out into surprising topics such as
[Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/)’s
[HOWTO: Get Tenure](http://matt.might.net/articles/tenure/).)
